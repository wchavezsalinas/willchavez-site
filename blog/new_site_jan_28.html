            Hey everyone, this is my first blog post on my newly designed website. üòä
          </p> 
          <p>
            I've been working on and off on this redesign for a while now. 
            To be honest, I think it's been like 3 or 4 months already. I'm incredibly slow to get actual things out the door.
            I've redesigned this page a couple of times in the last 2 years. 
            I first had my work on <a href="https://github.com/willchavez/vvilliann.com">vvilliann.com</a> (now defunct) which used a modified bootstrap template I found online. 
            I was learning Angular.js at the time, so I was trying to incorporate elements of that in the webpage.
            I posted tiny tidbits about my day, thoughts I had, and added my <a href="https://twitter.com/_willchavez">twitter</a>, 
            and <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/wchavezsalinas">last.fm</a> feed. 
            I kept that going for about a solid 6 months before I got tired of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, in an effort to learn more about the <a href="http://mean.io/">MEAN</a> stack development, 
            I moved my work to <a href="http://willchavez.com">willchavez.com</a> and redesigned my page again, 
            and this time I tried approaching it with minimal design. Meaning, I tried keeping it's layout very basic and tried
            not to add any unnecessary details that clouded my view. But long story short... I ended up being over-engineering a site 
            that merely meant to be used as a blog and portfolio for my work. 
            I had no real need for a Mongo database, and didn't really need the full power of an MVC like Angular.js. 
            So for a while my site acted just as a landing page. üòï
          </p>
          <img src="../img/jan_28_pic1.png" data-action="zoom" height="70%" width="70%">
          <p>
            After leaving my website as a landing page for more than a year, I finally decided to start working on something official. 
            I decided to use tachyons.io as the css toolkit and I tried out several static site generators like Jekyll, and Middleman. 
            They're very handy but there were so many things that I had to learn that I eventually got tripped up by it. 
            I finally broke down and just decided to write all the things I needed myself, without the help of a static site generator. 
            I know it'll present a lot of problems in the future especially as I write more posts. If I want to suddenly re-design this page,
            it'll take a lot more time to apply the updates. But I figure having something out to the world is better 
            than having nothing out.What you're seeing is where I'm currently at.
          </p>

          <p class="pt4 pb4">Now for the future...</p>

          <p>
            I want to start blogging again, and not in a, "Writes about tech topics or tutorials" sense. 
            I mean, if I want to do that, I certainly will. I just don't want this to exclusively be a tech journal. I'll be writing about my life,
            things that inspire me, and just stuff that I find dope. 
          </p>

          <p>Anyway, thank you for reading this. Gonna get to work. üí™üèΩ</p>
